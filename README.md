# Project 004 - Pacman

# Abstract

In this project we plan to make a Player vs. Player version of Pacman. In our Pacman game you can compete against your friend up to four players at the time. In our version you compete against each other, where you can eat each other to steal a sum of their points, to further increase your total score points. There will be a central server to handle the clients but most of the logic will be distributed to the clients using the server purely for syncing and to avoid abuse of the game for cheating. The entire program will be developed in Java using JavaFX for the GUI. The backend will run and be hosted on a server while the players will have to run the client program locally. To avoid the need for players to install java we plan to compile the client program to a jar file and create an exe file that includes a JRE.

# Demo video

> Add here a link to a video showing how your project runs. The video does not need to explain anything about how you designed or coded your project. Just show how it runs. There is no time limit or specific format. You can put it on YouTube or similar.

Demo video: https://youtu.be/paWE-GvDO1c?si=SR6srFgJOtMZ1ECE

> If your demo video uses one single computer (as it would be easier to screencast), please add a link to an additional video showing that it can also run on multiple computers.

> As a back-up, please upload the videos as part of your submission.

# Main coordination challenge

> Most likely you have been addressing and sovling many coordination challenges. Which one was the most challenging? Which solution are you most proud?. Choose just one. Use a few diagrams to illustrate the challenge and the solution. Use a few paragraphs to explain it. Refer to the materials from the mandatory materials (modules 1-3) and recommended materials (modules 4-6, Klempmann's course, etc.). That is, use the precise terminology and add references. This part shold not be longer than 2 screens (approx.).

# Programming language and coordination mechanism

> If you use a tuple space library from [pSpaces](https://github.com/pSpaces) just write something like "This project is based on the tuple space library X" where X is jSpace, dotSpace, etc.
> If you use something else implement coordination, you will have to describe here how the coordination concepts and mechanisms in the frameworks you use relate to the ones we use in the course. For example, if you decide to use Erlang you will have to explain inboxes and all that in terms of tuple spaces. The goal should be that anyone that has followed the couse materials, should be able to understand what you did, even if you decided not to use pSpaces libraries.

# Installation

> Provide here installation requirements and instructions. Your goal here is that anyone else following the course should be able to follow the steps and run your project.

# References 
> List here the main references that you have been using in your text above (course materials, articles, webtsites, etc.)
